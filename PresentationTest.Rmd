This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.



## What is a Coordinate Reference System? (CRS)

- CRS defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth (or other bodies)
- coordinates consist of two numbers representing distance from an origin, usually in x then y dimensions
- Geographic coordinate systems identify any location on the Earth’s surface using two values (longitude and latitude)
- associating numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth
- CRS are like measurement units for coordinates: they specify which location on Earth a particular coordinate pair refers to
- all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS.

## Definition: Projection

- CRSs are either geographic or projected
- Geographic CRS, e.g. Ellipsoidal models are defined by two values: the equatorial radius and the polar radius
- All projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS; transform 3D to 2D with Easting and Northing values
  - projecting is always distorted (impossible to have a perfect representation od area, direction, distance, and shape at the same time)

## One component of the CRS: the Datum

Datum:
- geodetic datum, not optimized for a specific location (WGS84)
- local datum, aligns perfectly with the surface at a particular location (NAD83)

## So, how can we define the CRS and the projection in R?

- Spatial R packages support a wide range of CRSs and they use the long-established PROJ library
- describe CRSs in R with
- Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID), short and easy to remember
  - most popular: EPSG:4326 represents the latitude/longitude WGS84 CRS, and ESRI:54030 -        Robinson projection
- or with well-known text (WKT216) definitions, exhaustive, detailed, and precise
  - consists of all information about any given CRS, including its datum and ellipsoid, prime     meridian, projection, units, etc, which makes it more complex
  

## What is Simple Features for R? (sf)

<div class="columns-2">
  ![](sf-classes.png){width=95%}


- sf is a package providing a class system for geographic vector data
- combines functionality of several previous packages (sp, rgdal and rgeos)
- basic building blocks of sf: different geometry types that are needed for vector geometry types
- well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT) are the standard encoding
- find more useful information about sf in its vignette (vignette("sf1")

## Slide with R Output
- sf objects are stored in dataframes, the geographical data can be found in the ‘geom’ coloumn (contains coordinates of the country polygons)
Look at this example from the world dataset in sf:
```{r sf, echo = TRUE}

summary("world")

```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
