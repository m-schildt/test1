## What is a Coordinate Reference System? (CRS)

- CRS defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth (or other bodies)

- associating numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth


## Definition: Projection

- CRSs are either <b>geographic or projected</b>
- Geographic CRS, e.g. Ellipsoidal models are defined by two values: the equatorial radius and the polar radius (longitude and latitude) so that any location on the Earth’s surface can be identified 
- All projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS; transform 3D to 2D with Easting and Northing values
  - projecting is always distorted (impossible to have a perfect representation od area, direction, distance, and shape at the same time)
  

## Geographic vs. projected CRS

## One component of the CRS: the Datum
contains information on what ellipsoid to use and the precise relationship between the Cartesian coordinates and location on the Earth’s surface

- geodetic datum, not optimized for a specific location (WGS84)
- local datum, aligns perfectly with the surface at a particular location (NAD83)

## So, how can we define the CRS and the projection in R?
- Spatial R packages support a wide range of CRSs and they use the long-established PROJ library
- describe CRSs in R with
- Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID), short and easy to remember
  - most popular: EPSG:4326 represents the latitude/longitude WGS84 CRS, and ESRI:54030 -        Robinson projection
- or with well-known text (WKT216) definitions, exhaustive, detailed, and precise
  - consists of all information about any given CRS, including its datum and ellipsoid, prime     meridian, projection, units, etc, which makes it more complex
  

## What is Simple Features for R? (sf)

- sf is a package providing a class system for geographic vector data
- combines functionality of several previous packages (sp, rgdal and rgeos)
- basic building blocks of sf: different geometry types that are needed for vector geometry types
- find more useful information about sf in its vignette (vignette("sf1")

## Most common geometry types

## sf in practice
- sf objects are stored in dataframes, the geographical data can be found in the ‘geom’ coloumn (contains coordinates of the country polygons)
- all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS

## Look at this example from the world dataset in sf:
```{r sf, echo=TRUE}
head(world)
```

## simple plot of the geograpgic data
```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(world)

```


## Look at the magic behind it
```{r echo=TRUE}
st_crs(world)$IsGeographic
```

You can see that R shows unprojected (3d) data on a 2d screen

## with ggplot

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world)
```

## different stuff
```{r}
st_crs(world)$srid
st_crs(world)$proj4string
st_is_longlat(world)


# remember, all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS! We can transform it easily with sf

world_proj = data.frame(world) %>% 
  st_as_sf(crs = 102041)

world_proj2 <- st_transform(world, 3857)

st_is_longlat(world_proj)
plot(world_proj2)
```


## plot projected world
```{r}
plot(world_proj)
```
