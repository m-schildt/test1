- sf is a package providing a class system for geographic vector data
- combines functionality of several previous packages (sp, rgdal and rgeos)
- basic building blocks of sf: different geometry types that are needed for vector geometry types
- well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT) are the standard encoding
- find more useful information about sf in its vignette (vignette("sf1")

## Slide with R Output
- sf objects are stored in dataframes, the geographical data can be found in the ‘geom’ coloumn (contains coordinates of the country polygons)
Look at this example from the world dataset in sf:
```{r sf, echo = TRUE}

summary("world")
