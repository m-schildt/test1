# What is a Coordinate Reference System? (CRS)

- let's start with the basics: A Coordinate System is a set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points


- CRS defines <b>how the spatial elements of data relate to the surface of the Earth</b> (by a datum)

# One component of the CRS: the Datum

contains information on what ellipsoid to use and the precise relationship between the Cartesian coordinates and location on the Earth’s surface

- geocentric datum, not optimized for a specific location (WGS84)
- local datum, aligns perfectly with the surface at a particular location (NAD83)

# Definition: Projection

- CRSs are either <b>geographic or projected</b>
- Geographic CRS, e.g. Ellipsoidal models are defined by two values: the equatorial radius and the polar radius (longitude and latitude) 
- All projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS; transform 3D to 2D with Easting and Northing values
  - projecting is always distorted (impossible to have a perfect representation od area, direction, distance, and shape at the same time)

# So, how can we work with CRS in R?
- Spatial R packages can work with various CRSs, use the long-established PROJ library
- describe CRSs in R with
- Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID), short and easy to remember
  - most popular: EPSG:4326 represents the latitude/longitude WGS84 CRS, and ESRI:54030 -        Robinson projection
- or with well-known text (WKT216) definitions, exhaustive, detailed, and precise
  - consists of all information about any given CRS, including its datum and ellipsoid, prime     meridian, projection, units, etc, which makes it more complex

# What is Simple Features for R? (sf)

- sf is a package providing a class system for geographic vector data
- combines functionality of several previous packages (sp, rgdal and rgeos)
- basic building blocks of sf: different geometry types that are needed for vector geometry
- find more useful information about sf in its vignette (vignette("sf1")

---

# sf in practice
- sf objects are stored in dataframes, the geographical data can be found in the ‘geom’ coloumn (contains coordinates of the country polygons)
- all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS

---

# Look at this example from the world dataset in sf:
```{r sf, echo=TRUE}
options(width = 60)
head(world)
```
---

# simple plot of the geograpgic data
```{r echo=TRUE}
install.packages("spData")
world_proj = st_transform(world, "+proj=eck4")
plot(st_geometry(world_proj))
```

---


# with ggplot

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world)
```
---


# sf and its useful functions
```{r echo=TRUE}
st_crs(world) # get CRS
st_crs(world)$IsGeographic # check if its geographic or projected
st_crs(new_vector)$units_gdal #find out the CRS units
st_crs(world)$srid # get the SRID
st_crs(world)$proj4string # get the proj4string

# remember, all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS! We can transform it easily with sf

world_proj = data.frame(world) %>% 
  st_as_sf(crs = 102041)

#can be either SRID ("EPSG:4326" in the example), complete WKT2 representation (proj4string) or CRS (WGS 84)

```

---

# fun things we can do with sf
```{r echo=TRUE}
#calculate areas
France = world[world$iso_a2 == "FR", ]
st_area(France)
units::set_units(st_area(France), km^2)

```
